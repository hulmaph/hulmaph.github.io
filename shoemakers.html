	  		<h4>of OLY Shoes</h4>
	  		<p>Before he bagged the reputation of being the "Presidential Shoemaker that Marikina is very prideful of, he was just a shoemaker who was very talented and passionate with the craft because of growing up in a family of sapateros. His talent brought him to so many places but in the end, he couldn't resist but comeback to his hometown. He became very optimistic about rising from the crisis of the industry by making a living out of the craft he is most passionate in."</p>
	  		<p>Being very hands on with the craft, he never gets tired of doing the craft on a daily basis because for him, it is something he will keep doing as long as his body permits him to.</p>
